# Contributing to Developer Salary Prediction Model

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **Developer Salary Prediction Model** project!  
This project is designed to estimate software developer salaries based on factors such as experience, location, education and role. Every contribution ‚Äî whether small or large ‚Äî helps improve its accuracy, usability and impact.



## üèÜ How You Can Contribute

- **Data Enhancement**: Extend or improve the dataset. e.g., include additional countries, more experience levels, more features like job title, company size or bonus.  
- **Model Improvement**: Try alternative regression algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, ensemble methods, feature engineering, or advanced techniques like SHAP for interpretability.  
- **Visualization & Analysis**: Add insightful charts, correlation heatmaps, interactive dashboards or notebooks that help users understand model behaviour.  
- **Documentation**: Improve README, write beginner-friendly walkthroughs, code comments, usage examples, or deployment instructions.  
- **Testing & Reproducibility**: Add unit tests, ensure notebooks run end-to-end, improve model deployment pipeline, or simplify the user interface.
